### Overview

Dai 1.0 is a simplification of the Dai Stablecoin System intended for field
testing and refining Dai components. Dai 1.0 has several features that
distinguish it from future versions:

- trusted price feed
- single collateral type
- liquidations at fixed price (rather than auctions)

This API documentation is an introduction to Dai, aimed at those seeking an
understanding of the Solidity implementation. We assume knowledge of the [white
paper], a high level overview of Dai. A reading of the [purple paper], the (in
progress) detailed Dai technical specification and reference implementation, is
strongly encouraged but not required.
