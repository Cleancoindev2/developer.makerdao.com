## Collateral Pool

TODO - diagram

Pooled collateral is represented by a token `PETH` which has a variable
supply. which is the mechanism by which surpluses generated by the system are
realised. Surpluses are paid by burning `PETH` causing its value to rise
proportional to pooled collateral. If `PETH` has to be issued to cover forced
liquidations the value of the claim can also fall during times of volatility.
Over time a well managed system is expected to accumulate surplus which will
be earned by `PETH` holders.

Anyone can deposit `ETH` to the pool via `join`, and withdraw `ETH` via
`exit`. Pooled `ETH` is represented by `PETH` which is minted on `join` and
burned on `exit`, representing a proportional claim on pooled collateral.
