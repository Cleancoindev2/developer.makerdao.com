## Collateralized Debt

TODO - diagram

New `dai` is issued

Pooled collateral `PETH` can be locked up and used to borrow `DAI` in records known as CDPs (Collateralized Debt Positions). A CDP - Collateralized Debt Position (`cup`), allows pooled ETH to be used as collateral for issuance of new DAI.
