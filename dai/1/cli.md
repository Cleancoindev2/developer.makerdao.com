### Dai CLI

The [Dai CLI](https://github.com/makerdao/dai-cli) is a client for command-line
interaction with the [core system]({{ "dai/1/api" | relative_url  }}) contracts on
the Ethereum blockchain. It's built on [Seth](https://github.com/dapphub/seth),
the unix inspired, blockchain automation & open source finance toolkit,
maintained by the [DappHub](https://dapphub.com) collective.

#### Installing

Dai is distributed via [the Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix),
enabling cryptographically precise dependency tracking. First, install Nix
itself:

    $ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

Then add DappHub's distribution channel and install `dai`:

    $ nix-channel --add https://nix.dapphub.com/pkgs/dapphub $ nix-channel
    --update $ nix-env -iA dapphub.dai

See [dapp.tools](https://dapp.tools) for more software available through our
channel.

#### Upgrading

To upgrade Dai to the latest release, update the channel and then
reinstall:

    $ nix-channel --update
    $ nix-env -iA dapphub.dai

#### Configuration

Dai accepts the following options, which can be set as variables or passed as flags:

    -F --from  ETH_FROM      sender address
    -G --gas   ETH_GAS       gas quantity
    -C --chain SETH_CHAIN    remote node target (ethlive or kovan)
       --cup   DAI_CUP       cup ID for cup operations

These variables can also be exported via bash script at `~/.sethrc` along with any
other [Seth configuration](https://github.com/dapphub/seth#configuration).

#### Connecting to the blockchain

By default, Dai assumes a local RPC node running on the default port.

It can also be run against a remote [Infura](https://infura.io) node from a
machine with no local copy of the blockchain using the `--chain` flag.

Ethlive dai system status:

    dai --chain ethlive status

or access the Dai deployment on the Kovan testnet:

    dai --chain kovan status

#### Example usage

```
# Set CDP owner wallet
export ETH_FROM=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111

$ dai -C ethlive open
Opening cup...
Waiting for transaction receipt...
Opened cup 7

export SETH_CHAIN=ethlive

$ dai --cup 7 lock 10.0

$ dai --cup 7 draw 500.0

$ dai --cup 7 cup
