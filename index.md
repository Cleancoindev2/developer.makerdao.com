## Earn
<p class="lead">Pool collateral.</p>

When the system is running well, PETH is expected to increase in value over time relative to ETH, providing a return to PETH holders.

- Stability fee. Liquidation penalty.
- Downside risk.
- A large collateral pool provides more assurance for `dai` holders.

## Arbitrage
<p class="lead">Compete for profit opportunities provided by the Maker platform.</p>

- Boom. Decreases PETH supply. PETH is bought and burnt in return for Dai (system surplus - joy)
- Bust. Increses PETH supply when insufficient collateral to sell-off. PETH is sold in exchange for Dai.
- Boom and Bust discounts are fixed at 3% right? Or is that spread? What's the incentive to participate? OTC with no slippage.
- Arbitrage seekers race to buy at a discount when surplus or deficit exists.
- Sophisticated PETH holders can use bust to hedge against loss?
